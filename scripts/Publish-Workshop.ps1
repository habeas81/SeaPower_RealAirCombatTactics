.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the mod's Workshop content folder and uploads it to Steam Workshop via steamcmd,
    without needing to launch the game or Steam client UI.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is shared across any Sea Power (or other Steam Workshop) mod repo. It reads
    per-repo settings from scripts\publish.json next to this script (NOT under workshop\, since
    that folder is copied wholesale into the shipped mod content):

        {
          "appId": 1286220,
          "workshopItemId": 3827346397,
          "contentFolder": "dist/RealAirCombatTactics"
        }

    - appId:          the Steam app ID of the game the mod is for.
    - workshopItemId: the Workshop published file ID to update. Use 0 to publish a brand-new item
                       (steamcmd will print the new ID; copy it back into publish.json afterwards).
    - contentFolder:  path, relative to the repo root, that contains the finished mod files
                       (already produced by the project's PostBuild target; run the "build" task first).

    Run the "build" task first (or let the "Build and Publish to Workshop" VS Code task do it for
    you). This script then:
      1. Uses a steamcmd install shared across all mod repos on this machine
         (%LOCALAPPDATA%\SeaPowerModTools\steamcmd), downloading it on first use anywhere.
      2. Writes a workshop_item.vdf pointing at the repo's content folder.
      3. Runs steamcmd +login <you> +workshop_build_item ... +quit.

    The first run (per machine) will prompt interactively in the terminal for your Steam password
    and, if MFA is enabled (recommended), a Steam Guard code. steamcmd caches the session under the
    shared tools folder, so later runs usually won't re-prompt. No password is ever stored in this
    script or in git.

.PARAMETER SteamLogin
    Your Steam account login name. Defaults to $env:SP_STEAM_LOGIN if set, otherwise prompts.

.PARAMETER ChangeNote
    The Workshop changelog entry for this update. Defaults to the latest git commit subject.
